# Readme for dotfiles-desu

## What is this?
After years of SVN and hg, I've finally decided to put Github to use.
Partly so I can learn git, but also because some of the indispensable
parts of my current workflow are hosted here, including the homebrew 
package manager and TextMate 2.

I'm still not sure how much I'll use github, but we'll see. The Bird is The Word.

## No, really, what is this?
As my first test repo, this is nothing special. Mostly it will serve as a 
replacement for my SVN dotfiles repo on my old VPS which I've since 
retired. That was a lot of acronyms, FYI. This includes:

* dotfiles for shells, apps and so on
* VM initialisation scripts for VirtualBox, QEMU and such
* one off Perl scripts
* probably more

## Wouldn't these work better as gists?
Yes.
